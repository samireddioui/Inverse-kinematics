# Inverse-kinematics
In computer animation and robotics, inverse kinematics is the mathematical process of calculating the variable joint parameters needed to place the end of a kinematic chain, such as a robot manipulator or animation character's skeleton, in a given position and orientation relative to the start of the chain. Given joint parameters, the position and orientation of the chain's end, e.g. the hand of the character or robot, can typically be calculated directly using multiple applications of trigonometric formulas, a process known as forward kinematics. However, the reverse operation is, in general, much more challenging.

Due to the complex calculations behind the inverse kinematics, this code was done in order to help you find the robot's links angles to achieve the desired position for your end effector by choosing the length of your robot's links and specifying the desired position of the end effector (px, py, pz). This function is helpful for RRR robots.
